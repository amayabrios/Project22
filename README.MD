# Project22

### Summary:

#### Currently working on... Branch 1
thinking about how I'm storing the data, optimizing that, currently a csv
creating functions that will automate adding data based on user inputed movie name
as of now I am the only user but the big picture idea is that anyone will be able 
to contribute to the movie repository if the movie meets the qualifications,
these qualifications will be determined during branch 2/3 in the classification part of it

#### Branch 1: Build the dataset
Building movie dataset, justify why I'm doing this instead of pulling from one 
of the thousands of movie data repositories
API practice (mainly)

#### Branch 2: Run data analysis
Running data analysis on movies gathered, find patterns commonalities, 
potentially build to creating classification algorithm for these movies, 
contrast them to the biggest movies of the last 50 or so years
incorporate Einblick into this part

#### Branch 3: ML system
Implementing machine learning tools/principles, user data, recommender system, 
classification system determine by branch 3
